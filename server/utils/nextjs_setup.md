# Fixing "next: command not found" Error

If you're encountering the "next: command not found" error when trying to run your Next.js development server, here are the steps to resolve it:

## Solution Steps:

1. **Make sure you're in the right directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/summit27/Documents/Uni/FYP/algogpt-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Try running with npx**:
   ```bash
   npx next dev
   ```

4. **Check if Next.js is in your package.json**:
   ```bash
   cat package.json | grep next
   ```
   If Next.js is not listed in the dependencies, add it:
   ```bash
   npm install next --save
   ```

5. **Install Next.js globally** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm install -g next
   ```

6. **Check your Node.js version**:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   Make sure it meets the requirements for your Next.js version.

7. **Try clearing npm cache**:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

8. **Check for any conflicting global installations**:
   ```bash
   npm list -g --depth=0
   ```

After following these steps, try running the development server again:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you continue to experience issues, consider reinstalling Node.js and npm.
